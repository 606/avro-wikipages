# Avro Knowledge Base

Welcome to the Avro Knowledge Base wiki!

This wiki demonstrates a deep sidebar navigation tree structure for organizing Avro-related documentation.

## Getting Started

Browse through the sidebar to explore the hierarchical structure of topics, from `aa` all the way down to `ll`.

## Navigation

Use the sidebar on the right to navigate through the deep tree structure:
- **aa** - Root level topic
  - **bb** - Second level
    - **cc** - Third level
      - And so on...

## Purpose

This structure allows for organizing complex documentation in a hierarchical manner, making it easy to:
- Group related topics together
- Navigate through parent-child relationships
- Maintain a clear information architecture

For more information, start with [[aa]].
